# Water-Analysis

Possible sources of systematic error
- changing indices of refraction for materials at different temperatures. Is this exaggerated at different angles? 
- density effects? not likely, water doesn't change volume much
- changes in optical alignment at different temperatures
- microbubble effects? Volume would be temperature dependent... not likely this
- Light leak leading to a UV-bleaching like effect. Very curious about this...

Switching to SiPMs

- MPPC S14160 series by Hamamatsu might work with a WLS 
- WLS Eljen EJ286 would shift UV down to 250nm up to 440nm
